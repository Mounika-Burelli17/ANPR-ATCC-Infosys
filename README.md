ANPR-ATCC: Advanced Automatic Number Plate Recognition & Traffic Classification System
Project Overview
ANPR-ATCC is a powerful, unified traffic monitoring platform combining:

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR): Real-time detection and OCR extraction of vehicle license plates from images, videos, and camera streams.
Automatic Traffic Classification (ATCC): Multi-class vehicle detection supporting traffic density classification from live or recorded media.
This solution leverages the best of modern computer vision and OCR technologies, providing a scalable, flexible, and easy-to-use system ready for deployment in smart city projects, traffic analytics, law enforcement, and academic research.
